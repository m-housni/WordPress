/*
About Wordpress Salts
---------------------

 WordPress salts or secret keys are random strings of code containing eight variables that encrypt your login details.

They’re added to your password to secure your WordPress login credentials further. This ensures your passwords are immune to brute-force attacks 
and similar hacking methods.

When logging into the Dashboard, a number of browser cookies containing WordPress login information –  namely, 
wordpress_[hash] and wordpress_logged_in_[hash] – are created and stored inside your computer. 
This means that if a hacker can access your web browser’s cookies, they can extract your passwords.

Fortunately, with security keys and salts, all your login details are hashed, 
meaning that they are encrypted using a sequence of random strings. These strings are visible while the actual password isn’t.

Every time you input sensitive data on WordPress, such as your username or email address and password, 
salts will regenerate the plain text used as your password into a randomly encrypted text.

For example, if your password is “yourpassword”, using WordPress salts, 
it will be stored as random characters like “SG^&%@KD>>:_+$#%HBJH**6#jkj”. 
Attackers will not be able to decipher your actual password even if they gain access to your site’s code.
